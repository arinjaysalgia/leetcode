 *  This is the LeetCode Problem:
 *https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/dynamic-programming/631/strategy-for-solving-dp-problems/4147/
 *
 * Where you are expected to Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
    Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.
 *
 *
 * Logic:
 *   This is a classic dp problem where the same problem can be solved with
 *   Overlapping subproblems and Optimal substructures.
 *   Something to be aware of here is we only need the sum of total occurrence of each number to
 *   decide if we should pick that number, its postion is irrelevant.
 *    We use a hashMap to store the sum of occurrence of each number.
 *   Base Condition : dp(0) = 0, dp(1) = Map.getOrDefault(1, 0)
 *    Recurrence Relationship : Cost at any step  i is given by :
 *       dp[i] = dp[i -1] + dp[i - 2]  + map.getOrDefault(i, 0).
 *
 * Time complexity: O(N+k)
     * To populate points, we need to iterate through nums once, which costs O(N) time.
     * Then, we call maxPoints(maxNumber). This call will repeatedly call maxPoints until we get
     * down to our base cases. Because of cache, already solved sub-problems will only cost O(1) time.
     * Since maxNumber = k, we will solve k unique sub-problems so,
     * this recursion will cost O(k) time. Our final time complexity is O(N + k).
 *
 * Space complexity: O(N + k) for TopDown and BottomUp
    * The extra space we use is the hash table points,
    * the recursion call stack needed to find maxPoints(maxNumber), and the hash table cache.
    * The size of points is equal to the number of unique elements in nums. In the worst case,
    * where every element in nums is unique, this will take O(N) space.
    * The recursion call stack will also grow up to size k, since we start our recursion at maxNumber,
    * and we don't start returning values until our base cases at 0 and 1.
    * Lastly, cache will store the answer for all states, from 2 to maxNumber,
    * which means it also grows up to k size. Our final space complexity is O(N+2â‹…k)= O(N+k).
*
* Space complexity : For optimizedBottomUP is O(N)
* Here the only thing that has changes is we are using constant space for computation and,
* The space required is only for the HashMap to store N elemets.
